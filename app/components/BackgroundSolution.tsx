						My Story: A Solo Studentâ€™s Journey
					</h3>
					<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-deepRed">
						As a solo student living away from home, I often found myself
						overwhelmed with schoolwork and struggled to plan my meals. I would
						spend too much time thinking about what to eat, often settling for
						unhealthy choices or skipping meals altogether.
						<br />
						<br />
						After creating and using DineDash, everything changed. With
						personalized meal plans tailored to my preferences and diet, I could
						focus more on my studies while enjoying balanced, healthy meals
						every day. DineDash saved me time and became the perfect companion
						to my busy academic life.
